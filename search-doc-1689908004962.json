In the vast majority of cases, you should be able to use implicit property values. To use them, just use a value that's the same shape as the type that the property has: &quot;MyPart&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Size&quot;: [3, 5, 3], &quot;Color&quot;: [0.5, 0, 0.5], &quot;Anchored&quot;: true, &quot;Material&quot;: &quot;Granite&quot; } }  Vector3 and Color3 properties can just be arrays of numbers, as can types like Vector2, CFrame, and more! Enums can be set to a string containing the enum variant. Rojo will raise an error if the string isn't a valid variant for the enum. There are some cases where this syntax for assigning properties doesn't work. In these cases, Rojo requires you to use the explicit property syntax. Some reasons why you might need to use an explicit property: Using exotic property types like BinaryStringUsing properties added to Roblox recently that Rojo doesn't know about yet The shape of explicit property values is defined by the rbx-dom library, so it uses slightly different conventions than the rest of Rojo. Each value should be an object with the following required fields: Type: The type of property to represent. Supported types can be found here. Value: The value of the property. The shape of this field depends on which property type is being used. Vector3 and Color3 values are both represented as a list of numbers, while BinaryString expects a base64-encoded string, for example. Here's the same object, but with explicit properties: &quot;MyPart&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Size&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Vector3&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: [3, 5, 3] }, &quot;Color&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Color3&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: [0.5, 0, 0.5] }, &quot;Anchored&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Bool&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: true }, &quot;Material&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Enum&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: 832 } } }  "},{"title":"Example Projects​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Project Format","url":"docs/v0.5/project-format/#example-projects","content":"This project bundles up everything in the src directory.

Enums can be set to a string containing the enum variant. Rojo will raise an error if the string isn't a valid variant for the enum. There are some cases where this syntax for assigning properties doesn't work. In these cases, Rojo requires you to use the explicit property syntax. Some reasons why you might need to use an explicit property: Using exotic property types like BinaryStringUsing properties added to Roblox recently that Rojo doesn't know about yet The shape of explicit property values is defined by the rbx-dom library, so it uses slightly different conventions than the rest of Rojo. Each value should be an object with the following required fields: Type: The type of property to represent. Supported types can be found here. Value: The value of the property. The shape of this field depends on which property type is being used. Vector3 and Color3 values are both represented as a list of numbers, while BinaryString expects a base64-encoded string, for example.

An implicit value uses Rojo's knowledge of Roblox's API to infer the correct type, while an explicit value specifies the type directly. When a value is specified implicitly, Rojo uses the class name and property name to validate the value. That is, the format of an implicit value must be correct for the type corresponding to the class and property. For example, the Anchored property of the Part class is known by Rojo to be of the Bool type, so the implicit value must be a boolean: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Anchored&quot;: true, } }  Conversely, an explicit value specifies the type of the value directly. An explicit value is an object with one field, where: The key of the field is the type of property to represent.The value of the field is the value of the property, in the format of the specified type. For example, the Anchored property specified explicitly: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Anchored&quot;: { &quot;Bool&quot;: true }, } }  For explicit values, Rojo does not validate the type against Roblox's API. For example, the type of the Anchored property could be overridden to be a string instead: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Anchored&quot;: { &quot;String&quot;: &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }, } }  Explicit values are necessary for properties that Rojo does not know about. This includes properties that have been recently added to Roblox's API, and certain internal properties that aren't described by Roblox's API at all. The Properties page describes the formats of each type in detail.

There are two ways to write properties in these files, the explicit syntax and implicit syntax. Rojo's implicit syntax has not changed. In Both Rojo 6 and 7, you can write properties like this: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cool-skateboard&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Material&quot;: &quot;Wood&quot;, &quot;Size&quot;: [2, 0.5, 6], &quot;Color&quot;: [1, 0, 0], &quot;CFrame&quot;: [ 0, 10, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } }  info It's strongly recommended to use the implicit syntax when possible! It's shorter, easier to read, and more future-proof. Rojo also has a more explicit syntax for specifying property values. This syntax should be used only for a couple reasons: Using an new enum value that Rojo doesn't know about.Writing a property with a different value type than what Rojo expects. In Rojo 6, this same model using the explicit property syntax would look like this: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cool-skateboard&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Material&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Enum&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: 512 }, &quot;Size&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Vector3&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: [2, 0.5, 6] }, &quot;Color&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Color3&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: [1, 0, 0] }, &quot;CFrame&quot;: { &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;CFrame&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;: [ 0, 10, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } } }  This format has changed in Rojo 7. The same model with Rojo 7's explicit property syntax would look like this: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cool-skateboard&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;Part&quot;, &quot;$properties&quot;: { &quot;Material&quot;: { &quot;Enum&quot;: 512 }, &quot;Size&quot;: { &quot;Vector3&quot;: [2, 0.5, 6] }, &quot;Color&quot;: { &quot;Color3&quot;: [1, 0, 0] }, &quot;CFrame&quot;: { &quot;CFrame&quot;: { &quot;position&quot;: [0, 10, 0], &quot;orientation&quot;: [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } } } }  In Rojo 7, the Type and Value fields were folded together to reduce the amount of typing. Some types like CFrame and ColorSequence had fields added or renamed. Since the release of Rojo 6, it has been feasible to use rbxm or rbxmx files for models instead of typing properties by hand. For more complicated models, this is recommended.
