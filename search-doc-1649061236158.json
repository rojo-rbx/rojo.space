Enums can be set to a string containing the enum variant. Rojo will raise an error if the string isn't a valid variant for the enum. There are some cases where this syntax for assigning properties doesn't work. In these cases, Rojo requires you to use the explicit property syntax. Some reasons why you might need to use an explicit property: Using exotic property types like BinaryStringUsing properties added to Roblox recently that Rojo doesn't know about yet The shape of explicit property values is defined by the rbx-dom library, so it uses slightly different conventions than the rest of Rojo. Each value should be an object with the following required fields: Type: The type of property to represent. Supported types can be found here. Value: The value of the property. The shape of this field depends on which property type is being used. Vector3 and Color3 values are both represented as a list of numbers, while BinaryString expects a base64-encoded string, for example.

There are two ways to write properties in these files, the explicit syntax and implicit syntax. Rojo's implicit syntax has not changed. In Both Rojo 6 and 7, you can write properties like this: { \"name\": \"cool-skateboard\", \"tree\": { \"$className\": \"Part\", \"$properties\": { \"Material\": \"Wood\", \"Size\": [2, 0.5, 6], \"Color\": [1, 0, 0], \"CFrame\": [ 0, 10, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } } Copy info It's strongly recommended to use the implicit syntax when possible! It's shorter, easier to read, and more future-proof. Rojo also has a more explicit syntax for specifying property values. This syntax should be used only for a couple reasons: Using an new enum value that Rojo doesn't know about.Writing a property with a different value type than what Rojo expects. In Rojo 6, this same model using the explicit property syntax would look like this: { \"name\": \"cool-skateboard\", \"tree\": { \"$className\": \"Part\", \"$properties\": { \"Material\": { \"Type\": \"Enum\", \"Value\": 512 }, \"Size\": { \"Type\": \"Vector3\", \"Value\": [2, 0.5, 6] }, \"Color\": { \"Type\": \"Color3\", \"Value\": [1, 0, 0] }, \"CFrame\": { \"Type\": \"CFrame\", \"Value\": [ 0, 10, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } } } Copy This format has changed in Rojo 7. The same model with Rojo 7's explicit property syntax would look like this: { \"name\": \"cool-skateboard\", \"tree\": { \"$className\": \"Part\", \"$properties\": { \"Material\": { \"Enum\": 512 }, \"Size\": { \"Vector3\": [2, 0.5, 6] }, \"Color\": { \"Color3\": [1, 0, 0] }, \"CFrame\": { \"CFrame\": { \"position\": [0, 10, 0], \"orientation\": [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] } } } } } Copy In Rojo 7, the Type and Value fields were folded together to reduce the amount of typing. Some types like CFrame and ColorSequence had fields added or renamed. Since the release of Rojo 6, it has been feasible to use rbxm or rbxmx files for models instead of typing properties by hand. For more complicated models, this is recommended. "}]
