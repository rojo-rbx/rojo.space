# Installation

There are two supported ways to install Rojo:

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install [the Rojo VS Code extension][extension], which allows for both halves of Rojo to work within Visual Studio Code, with a nifty UI to sync files and start/stop the Rojo server!

:::info
The VS Code extension does not add `rojo` to your system PATH. In order to use Rojo from the terminal, you'll need to install the CLI separately.
:::

[extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Rojo has two pieces that need to be installed:

- The Server
- The Roblox Studio plugin

## Installing the Server

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="winget" label="With winget" default>

[Winget] is the windows package manager. It comes pre-installed in the latest versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.

If you dont have it installed, you can install it from the [Microsoft Store]

> Note: The winget client requires Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) or later at this time. If you are running Windows 10 1803 or earlier, you will need to update your Windows 10 installation before you can install winget.

To install the latest release of Rojo, run the following commands:

```powershell
winget install rojo
```

[Microsoft Store]: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH4NNS1
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aftman" label="With Aftman">

[Aftman] is a toolchain manager that is useful for managing tools like Rojo for Roblox projects. To install it, follow these [instructions][aftman-installation-instructions].

To install the latest release of Rojo, run the following commands:

```bash
aftman add rojo-rbx/rojo
aftman install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

There are pre-built binaries available for Windows, macOS, and Linux from Rojo's [GitHub Releases page][rojo-releases].

The Rojo CLI must be run from the command line, like `cmd.exe` on Windows or `Terminal.app` on macOS. It's recommended that you put the Rojo CLI executable on your system `PATH` to make this easier.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="crates" label="From crates.io">

It's also possible to install Rojo releases using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This will compile Rojo from source and install it on your machine.

To install Rojo 7, use:

```sh
cargo install rojo --version ^7
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing the Plugin

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Using the CLI">

Once you've installed the Rojo server, you can use it to install or upgrade the Rojo plugin from the command line.

```bash
rojo plugin install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

The Rojo plugin is available from Rojo's GitHub Releases page.

Rojo has a separate plugin for each major version. Make sure you install the correct one!

Download the attached `rbxm` file and put it into your Roblox Studio plugins folder. You can find that folder by pressing **Plugins Folder** from your Plugins toolbar in Roblox Studio:
