## Creating the Rojo Project

Rojo has a built-in command to initialize a new game project.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

Open a new empty folder in VS Code. Your editor should look like this:

![empty VS Code project](/img/vscode/empty-project.png)

Open your VS Code Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+P` on Windows, `cmd+shift+P` on macOS) and type `Rojo: Open Menu`. Run the command that pops up:

![rojo init command](/img/vscode/init-command.png)

Select `Create one now` from menu to initialize Rojo project

![rojo initialize from menu](/img/vscode/menu-init.png)

Once it succeeds, you should see a bunch of new files:


![complete rojo project](/img/vscode/init-output.png)

These are all the files you need to get started with Rojo.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

First, open up a terminal window, like `cmd.exe` on Windows or `Terminal.app` on macOS. Navigate to where you'd like to store your new project and run

```sh
rojo init my-new-game
```

Rojo will create a folder named `my-new-game` if it doesn't already exist and create everything you need to get started.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building Your Place

Now that we have a project, one thing we can do is build a Roblox place file for our project. This is a great way to get started with a project quickly with no fuss.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

Open your VS Code Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+P` on Windows, `cmd+shift+P` on macOS) and type `Rojo: Open Menu`. Run the command that pops up:

![rojo init command](/img/vscode/init-command.png)

Click the `Build project` button.

![rojo build from menu](/img/vscode/build-command.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

All we have to do is run `rojo build` from inside the project's folder:

```sh
rojo build -o build.rbxlx
```

:::info
To generate a binary place file instead, use `build.rbxl`. Note that support for binary model/place files (`rbxm` and `rbxl`) is currently very limited in Rojo v6.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Rojo will create a file named `build.rbxlx` that contains your new game!

If you open `build.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio now, you should see a baseplate, as well as code in services like `ReplicatedStorage`.

## Live-Syncing into Studio

Building a place file is great for starting to work on a game, but for active iteration, you'll want something faster.

In Roblox Studio, make sure the Rojo plugin is installed. If you need it, check out [the installation guide](installation.mdx) to learn how to install it.

To expose your project to the plugin, you'll need to start the **live sync server**.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

Open your VS Code Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+P` on Windows, `cmd+shift+P` on macOS) and type `Rojo: Open Menu`. Run the command that pops up:

![rojo init command](/img/vscode/init-command.png)

Click the project button from Projects in this workspace section

![rojo serve command](/img/vscode/serve-command.png)

You should see a small popup in the bottom right corner of your screen with a few details.

![rojo serve output](/img/vscode/serve-output.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```sh
rojo serve
```

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```sh
$ rojo serve
Rojo server listening:
  Address: localhost
  Port:    34872

Visit http://localhost:34872/ in your browser for more information
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Switch into Roblox Studio and press the **Rojo** plugin toolbar button. A panel should open:

![Rojo plugin connection dialog](/img/plugin/connect-dialog.png)

Press **Connect**.

If all went well, you should now be able to change files in your project directory and watch them sync into Roblox Studio in real time!

You can also visit the URL printed by Rojo to access extra information about the running session.

## Uploading Your Place

Aimed at teams that want serious levels of automation, Rojo can upload places to Roblox.com automatically.

You'll need an existing game on Roblox.com as well as the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie of an account that has write access to that game.

:::warning
It's recommended that you set up a Roblox account dedicated to deploying your game instead of your personal account in case your security cookie is compromised.
:::

Generating and publishing your game is as simple as:

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

Uploading places is not yet supported in the Rojo VS Code Extension. You can publish your game using Roblox Studio or use the Rojo CLI instead.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```sh
rojo upload --asset_id [PLACE ID] --cookie "[SECURITY COOKIE]"
```

If you are on Windows and have Roblox Studio installed, `--cookie` is optional and will be pulled from your Roblox Studio session if not specified.

An example project is available on GitHub that deploys to Roblox.com via GitHub Actions automatically: [Desert Bus 2077](https://github.com/Roblox/desert-bus-2077)
