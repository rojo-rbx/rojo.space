This blog post won\'t go into the details of why, but if you\'re curious you can check out the [blog post he wrote on the subject][LPG Goodbye Blog]. The immediate impact of Lucien stepping away was that Rojo was left without a maintainer, since nobody else was a major contributor and no one volunteered.\\n\\nHowever, several months later, this has been resolved. Members of the Rojo organization and the folk in the Roblox Open Source Server are now actively maintaining Rojo and its related projects.\\n\\nThe only notable change you as a user should be aware of is that the Roblox Studio plugin is now published by a group on Roblox rather than Lucien\'s Roblox account. You can find the updated download link [here][Download Rojo Plugin]. This only impacts you if you are **not** letting Rojo manage the plugin for you.\\n\\nNo promises on this blog being updated going forward, since there isn\'t much that\'s \\"blog-worthy\\" to share. We just thought it was important to share an update on Rojo\'s maintenance and the future.\\n\\n[LPG Goodbye Blog]: https://lpg.space/post/2022-11-07-next-chapter\\n[Download Rojo Plugin]: https://www.roblox.com/library/13916111004/Rojo"},{"id":"new-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/new-website","editUrl":"https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo.space/edit/master/blog/2021-10-19-new-website.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-19-new-website.md","title":"New Website","description":"Welcome to the new Rojo website!","date":"2021-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 19, 2021","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lucien Greathouse","title":"Original Author of Rojo","url":"https://github.com/LPGhatguy","imageURL":"https://github.com/LPGhatguy.png","key":"lpg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"new-website","title":"New Website","authors":"lpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New Maintainers","permalink":"/blog/new-maintainers"}},"content":"Welcome to the new Rojo website!\\n\\nThe new Rojo website uses [Docusaurus], a static site generator focused on building great documentation websites.\\n\\nThe bulk of the work on this project was done by [unix-system].
