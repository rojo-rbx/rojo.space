# Installation

There are two supported ways to install Rojo:

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install [the Rojo VS Code extension][extension], which allows for both halves of Rojo to work within Visual Studio Code, with a nifty UI to sync files and start/stop the Rojo server!

:::info
The VS Code extension does not add `rojo` to your system PATH. In order to use Rojo from the terminal, you'll need to install the CLI separately.
:::

[extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Rojo has two pieces that need to be installed:

- The Server
- The Roblox Studio plugin

## Installing the Server

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="foreman" label="With Foreman" default>

[Foreman] is a toolchain manager that is useful for managing tools like Rojo for Roblox projects.

To install from the latest stable release channel of Rojo 6, add an entry to the `[tools]` section of your `foreman.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
rojo = { source = "rojo-rbx/rojo", version = "0.5" }
```

[Foreman]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/foreman

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

There are pre-built binaries available for Windows, macOS, and Linux from Rojo's [GitHub Releases page][rojo-releases].

The Rojo CLI must be run from the command line, like `cmd.exe` on Windows or `Terminal.app` on macOS. It's recommended that you put the Rojo CLI executable on your system `PATH` to make this easier.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="crates" label="From crates.io">

It's also possible to install Rojo releases using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This will compile Rojo from source and install it on your machine.

To install Rojo 0.5, use:

```sh
cargo install rojo --version ^0.5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing the Plugin

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

The Rojo plugin is available from Rojo's GitHub Releases page.
